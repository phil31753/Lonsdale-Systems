		<h1>Testing Requirements</h1> <h3>Essential Techniques for Agile and Waterfall Teams</h3><h2>Course Overview</h2>This course is for agile and waterfall teams who want to improve their ability to meet stakeholder expectations. It focuses on three ways this can be achieved:  by checking that the solution requirements will satisfy stakeholder needs;  by checking that the team is implementing the solution accurately; and by checking that the team has implemented a suitable solution.
<br><br>Central to the course is the relationship between software requirements and testing - sometimes known as Requirements Based Testing or Test Driven Requirements. The course explains the different approaches that agile and waterfall teams can follow, and highlights where a common approach works for both.
<br><br>Participants will leave the course with a better understanding of how to capture stakeholder expectations and how their expectations are related to software testing.
<br><br>Previous versions of this course were called  Requirements Based Testing and Requirements Verification.
<br><br><h2>Course Features</h2><ul><li>Clarifies the relationship between software requirements and testing.
</li><li>Offers proven, practical strategies for meeting stakeholder expectations.
</li><li>Suitable for graduates, Business Analysts, Software Developers, Test Analysts and Quality Assurance Staff moving into these roles for the first time; as well as experienced staff who need to update their skills, attend a refresher, or simply get some new ideas.
</li><li>Available as face-to-face course or as a virtual course with collaborative exercises based on a virtual canvas.
</li></ul><h2>Participant Benefits</h2><ul><li>Understanding of the role of software requirements and how these relate to software testing.
</li><li>Understanding of how the agile life cycle resolves issues with the waterfall life cycle related to requirements and testing.
</li><li>Ability to identify and document software requirements using natural language, use cases, user stories and formal requirements statements.
</li><li>Able to apply practical strategies to ensure that solution requirements will satisfy stakeholder needs;  the team is implementing the solution accurately; and that the team has implemented a suitable solution.
</li><li>Ability to develop a state chart model of a software solution and use the model to generate test scenarios.
</li><li>Hands-on experience gained from discussions, examples and short exercises based on a case study.
</li></ul><h2>Who Should Attend?</h2><ul><li>Those who are currently members of agile or waterfall teams who want to deliver software solutions that meet the expectations of their stakeholders, such as Business Analysts, Software Developers, Test Analysts and Quality Assurance Staff
</li><li>Those who want further develop their careers as agile or waterfall team members, such as, Business Analysts, Software Developers, Test Analysts
</li><li>Those who need to plan and manage delivery of software solutions that meet stakeholder expectations such as Product Owners, Product Managers, Scrum Masters, Program Managers, Project Managers and Project Sponsors
</li><li>Those who need to approve Requirements Specifications, Test Plans and Test Specifications; as well as those who manage software development activities such as Product Owners, Product Managers, Program Managers, Project Managers, Test Managers, Engineering Managers and Project Sponsors
</li><li>Those who want to gain an understanding of requirements based and test driven testing, such  as, Chief Information Officers (CIO),  Business Architects, Enterprise Architects and Data Architects
