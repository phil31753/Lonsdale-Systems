## Course Overview

The world has changed! It is increasingly difficult for Business Analysts to gather information using the tried and tested approach of face-to-face interviews. Even when organisations adopt a hybrid approach to work, it's not easy to get everyone in the office at the same time to conduct workshops. The solution for many, has been to "muddle" through poorly planned remote sessions lacking staff engagement and failing to be inclusive.

This two-day course is a much-needed solution. It offers a toolkit of techniques based on a facilitation framework that prompts staff to consider six key aspects of remote and hybrid sessions. The framework allows them to:

-   clearly define the objectives of a session;
-   plan the structure and timing of a session;
-   ensure participants collaborate effectively during a session;
-   anticipate how participant's informal relationships might help or hinder a session;
-   ensure all participant's feel included and engaged in the session; and
-   continuously assess the mood of individuals and the session as a whole.

The application of the framework is guided by a generic information gathering workflow and concrete examples of workflows for remote and hybrid sessions, face-to-face interviews and workshops.

The course adopts a "learn by doing approach", with plenty of hands-on activities that demonstrate the practical application of the facilitation framework and the information gathering work flows discussed during the course.

Based on the Mural&REG [^1] visual collaboration platform, the course emphasises a "digital first" approach to information gathering that addresses the challenges of remote and hybrid work.

At the end of the course, staff will have improved their ability to plan and facilitate sessions, bringing a more confident and professional approach to information gathering.
